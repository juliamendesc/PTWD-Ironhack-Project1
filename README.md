# PTWD-Ironhack-Project1 - Julia Carvalho - Groovy Snacks

Hi! Since I was a child, I have always enjoyed video games! My first console was the Super Nintendo and I only had three games to play. XD

One of the games I played the most was Scooby-Doo Mystery for SNES and I loved it! Inside that game, there was a mini-game in which we needed to assist Shaggy and Scooby-doo to put up two sandwiches.

This mini-game served as an inspiration to my project.
